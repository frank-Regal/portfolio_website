                My team and I in the Nuclear and Applied Robotics group 
                created an augemented reality base human-robot teaming system 
                called AugRE. The application allows users to supervise and command 
                robotic teammates. This work has recently been accepted for publication 
                in the 31st IEEE International Conference on Robot & Human Interactive 
                Communication conference (Ro-MAN 2022).
